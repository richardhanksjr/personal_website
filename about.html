        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            I am a software developer, musician, educator and, perhaps most importantly, a life-long student!
            I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardner,_Massachusetts">Gardner, MA</a> and developed an interest in music in the 5th grade.  This interest quickly became
            a single-minded focus on becoming a professional musician.  After graduating from high school, I went to Umass Amherst
            to study music.  After earning a Master's degree in trombone performance, I went on to play professionally for
            6 years in the United States Navy.  My time in the Navy gave him a chance to travel internationally, play for government officials,
            entertain troops, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2WKK8axGXg">perform for students</a>, play for professional football, baseball, and hockey games,
            and even play at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pQBILy56dw">Daytona 500</a>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            As my time in the Navy was coming to and end, I began to think about what I might do for a new career.  I took classes in
            educational psychology (learning and teaching are two of my most favorite interests) classes as well as premed (I'm also really interested in
            health) classes.  Then, on a whim, I tried my hands at an online coding tutorial and I instantly fell in love.  I began writing code
            every night after work and on the weekends.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            After being honorably discharged from the Navy, I decided to continue my software development training and went to Denver, CO
            to study Java and web development at The Skill Distillery, a 5 month intensive coding boot camp.  After graduation, I got a job
            as a software developer with Bank of America where I currently work as a Python/Django web developer for Global Information Security
            where I help develop solutions for our organization's cyber security team.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            In 2016, I decided to take me software development skills to the next level and I enrolled in Boston University's Master's in Software
            Development program.  I completed coursework for this in December, 2018 and officially graduated in 2019.  Currently, I am pursuing
            the Web Application Development graduate certificate from BU as I continue to improve my skills as a software developer.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I am a lifelong learner and teacher.  I truly enjoy the process of learning and teaching others.  To that end, I am currently
            researching methods to improve the education of software developers and plan to create helpful materials out of that research
            to help new and experienced developers improve their skills
